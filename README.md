# Circular Progress Bar

This project features three circular progress bars implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery. The progress bars start from 0% and animate to their respective end values:

- **First Bar:** Ends at 90%
- **Second Bar:** Ends at 100%
- **Third Bar:** Ends at 78%

The animation is achieved using `setInterval`, which continuously updates the progress of each bar until it reaches the specified end value.
